# Architecture

This document describes the current structure of `homesrvctl`, the boundaries between major modules, and the public contracts that should not drift casually.

## Design Goals

- Keep the operator model simple and explicit.
- Prefer convergent, idempotent mutation commands.
- Keep external-system integrations isolated from command wiring.
- Preserve stable public contracts where practical.
- Grow the project in small slices rather than speculative abstraction.

## Major Components

### CLI surface

- [`homesrvctl/main.py`](homesrvctl/main.py)
- [`homesrvctl/commands`](homesrvctl/commands)

Responsibilities:
- define the user-facing command tree
- parse flags and arguments
- format human-readable and JSON output
- orchestrate lower-level helpers
- host the terminal UI entrypoint

Should not do:
- embed Cloudflare request details directly
- embed `cloudflared` config parsing logic directly
- spread shell/process logic across individual commands

Over time, command modules should become thin orchestration and formatting layers over reusable services. The existing CLI remains a supported operator interface, not a transitional shell around a future web app.

### Service layer

- [`homesrvctl/services`](homesrvctl/services)

Responsibilities:
- implement reusable Python business logic without depending on Typer when practical
- return structured dataclasses or dictionaries that commands, the TUI, and future API/web layers can format
- wrap existing helpers first, then absorb command-owned orchestration in small slices
- keep mutation behavior explicit and testable

The first services inspect local stack directories, refresh cached stack state, run read-only local, Cloudflare, and SES provider observers, record operation history, and provide stack-listing results from either the live filesystem or the SQLite cache. Future services should cover additional provider observers and eventually mutation orchestration without duplicating CLI code.

### State store

- [`homesrvctl/state`](homesrvctl/state)

Responsibilities:
- own SQLite connection helpers, schema initialization, and store operations
- keep local cached/indexed/observed state rebuildable from config, filesystem, and provider observations
- store history such as observations, operations, and events without becoming the only source of truth
- avoid storing secrets

The default local database path is `~/.local/share/homesrvctl/homesrvctl.db`, with `HOMESRVCTL_STATE_DB_PATH` and command options available for overrides. Config files and live systems remain authoritative. Cached reads are acceptable for dashboards and explicit cached listing, but mutation commands must continue validating live state.

### Operation history layer

- [`homesrvctl/services/operations.py`](homesrvctl/services/operations.py)
- [`homesrvctl/commands/operations_cmd.py`](homesrvctl/commands/operations_cmd.py)

Responsibilities:
- expose durable operation records from the SQLite `operations` table
- let operator surfaces list and inspect workflow history without running live checks
- record important foreground workflows such as OpenTofu plan/apply with sanitized metadata
- avoid storing secrets, saved plan contents, or full provider/tool output
- prepare for future operation queues without executing background mutations

Operations currently describe foreground workflows and their result state: `running`, `completed`, or `failed` for the paths wired today. They are not jobs yet. The daemon does not consume the operations table, retry operations, apply OpenTofu plans, or run provider mutations. Future worker design must add explicit approval, safety, retry, and cancellation semantics before operations become executable jobs.

### Refresh and observer layer

- [`homesrvctl/services/refresh.py`](homesrvctl/services/refresh.py)
- [`homesrvctl/services/observers`](homesrvctl/services/observers)
- [`homesrvctl/services/stacks.py`](homesrvctl/services/stacks.py)
- [`homesrvctl/commands/refresh_cmd.py`](homesrvctl/commands/refresh_cmd.py)
- [`homesrvctl/commands/observe_cmd.py`](homesrvctl/commands/observe_cmd.py)

Responsibilities:
- snapshot observed local state into the SQLite store
- start with local-only stack directory and stack-local config observations
- run explicitly owned read-only local runtime observers for Docker Compose status, `cloudflared` runtime/config status, and Traefik reachability
- run explicit read-only Cloudflare and SES provider observation when selected
- avoid mutation commands, OpenTofu, and provider resource changes
- preserve enough structure that the daemon can run the same refresh and observer services periodically

The refresh layer records stack directory metadata, compose-file presence, stack-local config presence, scaffold metadata, and effective routing settings. The observer layer records read-only local runtime snapshots into `stack_observations` and `events`. The Cloudflare provider observer records token, zone, DNS, and tunnel readiness into `events` without creating, updating, or deleting Cloudflare resources. The SES provider observer records AWS/SES account, domain identity, DKIM, custom MAIL FROM, and DNS-readiness snapshots into `events` without mutating AWS, DNS, or SMTP credentials. OpenTofu, backups, and related provider observers belong to later slices.

### Site catalog layer

- [`homesrvctl/services/site_catalog.py`](homesrvctl/services/site_catalog.py)
- [`homesrvctl/commands/sites_cmd.py`](homesrvctl/commands/sites_cmd.py)

Responsibilities:
- discover read-only site operations metadata from configured stack directories and Docker Compose files
- expose compact list, full inventory, per-site info, and structural validation through the `sites` command family
- merge only explicitly safe user annotations from `~/.config/homesrvctl/sites.yaml` or an operator-supplied annotations path
- report source path and database hints without reading `.env` files, emitting Compose `environment` values, or exposing secret values

This layer is the first site-catalog slice intended for future wrappers, API clients, and dashboard surfaces. It is not a mutation surface and should not start, stop, deploy, or repair services.

### OpenTofu convergence layer

- [`homesrvctl/services/infra`](homesrvctl/services/infra)
- [`homesrvctl/commands/infra_cmd.py`](homesrvctl/commands/infra_cmd.py)

Responsibilities:
- render narrow OpenTofu workspaces from explicit operator intent
- detect the external `tofu` binary and report its version
- run `tofu init` and `tofu plan -detailed-exitcode`
- save explicit plan files when requested with `--out`
- apply only operator-supplied saved plan files after confirmation
- interpret plan exit codes without hiding stdout/stderr
- record sanitized apply metadata in SQLite events
- record sanitized plan/apply operation metadata in SQLite operations
- keep subprocess execution in services rather than command formatting code
- avoid writing provider credentials, SMTP credentials, or other secrets

The current OpenTofu path renders SES outbound mail plus Cloudflare DNS workspaces with AWS and Cloudflare provider authentication left to normal environment/provider configuration. It may model SES identities, DKIM, custom MAIL FROM, and Cloudflare DNS records in generated `.tf` files. Apply is supported only as an explicit foreground command against an existing saved plan file. `homesrvctl` does not run `tofu destroy`, import resources, edit state, generate SMTP credentials, or run apply from the daemon or a background operation worker. OpenTofu is optional and must not be required for normal stack, observer, daemon, or TUI workflows.

### Read-only daemon runtime

- [`homesrvctl/services/daemon.py`](homesrvctl/services/daemon.py)
- [`homesrvctl/services/daemon_systemd.py`](homesrvctl/services/daemon_systemd.py)
- [`homesrvctl/commands/daemon_cmd.py`](homesrvctl/commands/daemon_cmd.py)

Responsibilities:
- run the existing local refresh service periodically in a foreground observer loop
- optionally run local runtime observers after refresh when `--observe-runtime` is enabled
- optionally run read-only Cloudflare provider observation after refresh when `--observe-cloudflare` is enabled
- optionally run read-only SES provider observation after refresh when `--observe-ses` is enabled
- render, install, uninstall, and inspect the systemd unit for the same read-only daemon
- keep the SQLite stack cache fresh without becoming an authority
- record daemon lifecycle and issue events in the state store
- report persisted cache/refresh status and systemd state through `daemon status`

The current daemon is read-only. Systemd support only manages the daemon process lifecycle. Runtime observers can inspect Docker Compose status, local `cloudflared` status/config, and Traefik reachability. The Cloudflare provider observer can inspect token, zone, DNS, and tunnel readiness. The SES provider observer can inspect AWS/SES account, identity, DKIM, custom MAIL FROM, and DNS readiness. These paths must not start/stop containers, mutate `cloudflared`, expose an API/web server, mutate provider resources, generate credentials, send email, or perform stack/domain mutations. Future daemon slices may add more provider observers and operation queues, but mutation commands should remain explicit and operator-confirmed until a later design deliberately changes that contract.

### Config and model layer

- [`homesrvctl/models.py`](homesrvctl/models.py)
- [`homesrvctl/config.py`](homesrvctl/config.py)
- [`homesrvctl/ports.py`](homesrvctl/ports.py)

Responsibilities:
- define global config structure
- define stack-local config structure
- resolve config paths and defaults
- load effective stack-local overrides
- inspect rendered stack files for service-port usage when operator reporting needs that view

This is the source of truth for:
- global config shape
- stack-local `homesrvctl.yml` shape
- default path conventions

Stack-local config may include a `scaffold` metadata block written by scaffold/wrapper commands. It is informational metadata used by `config show` and the TUI; routing behavior continues to come from `profile`, `docker_network`, and `traefik_url`.

### Cloudflare integration

- [`homesrvctl/cloudflare.py`](homesrvctl/cloudflare.py)

Responsibilities:
- Cloudflare DNS API interactions
- zone lookup
- DNS record inspection, upsert, and removal
- tunnel-target-related helper logic used by domain and tunnel-inspection flows

This module should stay focused on Cloudflare control-plane behavior, not local runtime orchestration.

The Cloudflare provider observer in [`homesrvctl/services/observers/cloudflare_provider.py`](homesrvctl/services/observers/cloudflare_provider.py) uses this module for read-only zone, DNS, and tunnel readiness checks. Provider observation belongs in services/observer modules, while Cloudflare API mechanics belong here. Command modules should not duplicate Cloudflare request logic.

Future note:
- If mail-provider admin support is introduced, it should not be added to `cloudflare.py` or folded into existing domain command wiring as ad hoc boto or SMTP calls.
- The frontend surface may use a generic `mail` command family, but provider logic should remain provider-specific.
- The SES observer in [`homesrvctl/services/observers/ses_provider.py`](homesrvctl/services/observers/ses_provider.py) is the first read-only mail-provider slice. It should stay observer-owned until a future `mail` command family is deliberately introduced.
- The OpenTofu convergence layer in [`homesrvctl/services/infra`](homesrvctl/services/infra) supports explicit saved-plan apply for the mail workspace. It should stay foreground, operator-approved, and mail-focused until operation queues or broader convergence are deliberately designed.
- A future generic `mail` command surface may accept `--provider`, but the default should stay `ses` until another provider is actually shipped.
- A future layout such as:
  - [`homesrvctl/mail_models.py`](homesrvctl/mail_models.py)
  - [`homesrvctl/mail_providers/ses.py`](homesrvctl/mail_providers/ses.py)
  can provide normalized output models plus provider-specific implementations without forcing a fake universal SMTP abstraction.
- Shared mail models should normalize only the parts that genuinely generalize:
  - provider name
  - domain/account inspection status
  - DNS record readiness
  - repairability
  - operator-facing issues and next steps
- Provider-specific detail such as SES DKIM state, custom MAIL FROM state, or account sandbox status should remain in provider-owned logic and may surface under explicit `provider_detail` output fields.

### Cloudflared ingress and runtime integration

- [`homesrvctl/cloudflared.py`](homesrvctl/cloudflared.py)
- [`homesrvctl/cloudflared_service.py`](homesrvctl/cloudflared_service.py)

Responsibilities:
- parse and validate `cloudflared` ingress config
- reconcile ingress entries for domain lifecycle commands
- detect `cloudflared` runtime mode
- inspect whether the configured `cloudflared` path is aligned with the active runtime
- inspect whether the current user can read the configured tunnel credentials JSON
- generate systemd-oriented setup guidance for the supported shared-group `root:homesrvctl` layout when the runtime, config path, service-control policy, or credentials access diverge
- support a one-time privileged bootstrap boundary where normal stack/domain/TUI operations later run as a trusted non-root operator in the `homesrvctl` and `docker` groups
- select restart/log commands appropriate for the detected runtime

Keep a clear separation between:
- config-file semantics
- runtime/process management

### Scaffold and template layer

- [`homesrvctl/templates`](homesrvctl/templates)
- [`homesrvctl/template_catalog.py`](homesrvctl/template_catalog.py)
- [`homesrvctl/adoption.py`](homesrvctl/adoption.py)
- [`homesrvctl/templates/static`](homesrvctl/templates/static)
- [`homesrvctl/templates/app`](homesrvctl/templates/app)

Responsibilities:
- render scaffold templates
- define the shipped scaffold catalog for commands, TUI flows, and release verification
- inspect existing app/site source directories before wrapper/adoption flows mutate anything
- generate homesrvctl-owned wrapper files around existing source without modifying app-owned files
- keep template families organized
- support site and app initialization without making `homesrvctl` a general-purpose framework generator

The per-template directory layout under `templates/app/` is intentional and should be preserved.
The scaffold catalog should stay as the source of truth for shipped app-template names, operator-facing descriptions, and rendered file manifests.
`site init` remains a separate minimal scaffold family from `app init --template static`; that split is intentional until a later design decision says otherwise.
Scaffold scope should stay within the philosophy recorded in [`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md): small deployable baselines, not framework stacks.
Existing-app adoption should start read-only and report evidence, confidence, issues, and concrete next steps before any wrapper files are generated.
Wrapper generation should keep the ownership boundary clear: source directories remain app-owned, while generated Compose, README, and stack-local config files remain homesrvctl-owned under the configured sites root.

### Shared utilities

- [`homesrvctl/shell.py`](homesrvctl/shell.py)
- [`homesrvctl/utils.py`](homesrvctl/utils.py)

Responsibilities:
- common shell execution behavior
- filesystem helpers
- shared small utilities used by command modules

These helpers should stay generic and reusable rather than accumulating feature-specific logic.

### Bootstrap assessment

- [`homesrvctl/bootstrap.py`](homesrvctl/bootstrap.py)
- [`homesrvctl/commands/bootstrap_cmd.py`](homesrvctl/commands/bootstrap_cmd.py)

Responsibilities:
- assess fresh-host readiness for the planned Debian-family bootstrap target
- provision the shared Cloudflare tunnel and local bootstrap material for later host/runtime wiring
- converge the host runtime baseline for the first bootstrap target, including packages, shared directories/groups, Docker network, and baseline Traefik runtime
- converge the shared-group `cloudflared` config path, tunnel credentials layout, and systemd service wiring
- aggregate the completed bootstrap slices into one explicit final host-readiness result
- detect current host/package/runtime/config/token state without mutating the host
- keep bootstrap orchestration separate from the existing domain, stack, and runtime command modules

The current shipped slices cover assessment, Cloudflare tunnel provisioning plus local bootstrap material writing, host runtime baseline convergence, shared-group cloudflared wiring, and a final bootstrap-readiness aggregation step.
Future bootstrap mutation flows should continue building on this layer rather than spreading provisioning logic across unrelated modules.

## Current Architectural Boundaries

### Commands should orchestrate, not reimplement helpers

Command modules may decide:
- what action to run
- which helper to call
- how to present the result

Command modules should avoid:
- custom YAML parsing when `cloudflared.py` already owns it
- ad hoc Cloudflare API requests
- ad hoc subprocess behavior already covered by `shell.py`

The TUI command wrapper follows the same rule: it should prefer orchestrating stable JSON command output over reaching into unrelated modules directly unless that boundary becomes a maintenance problem.

### Terminal UI layer

- [`homesrvctl/tui`](homesrvctl/tui)

Responsibilities:
- host the Textual application and related screens/widgets
- load dashboard and action data from the existing JSON command surface
- render terminal dashboard views, detail panes, and guided flows
- manage TUI-local selection and detail state
- keep TUI-specific state and refresh behavior out of the command modules

This layer should stay separate from CLI wiring so future dashboard/view growth does not bloat `homesrvctl/commands`.
Textual is now the active and only retained implementation for `homesrvctl tui`.
The command wrapper should import the Textual app lazily so the rest of the CLI can still start cleanly if the local environment has not yet been refreshed to include the new dependency.
The shipped TUI now covers the public CLI surface with a mix of guided mutation flows, focused tool menus, and read-only detail views instead of relying on a separate backend model.
For stack lists, the TUI tries the cached JSON list first and falls back to the live JSON list when the database is missing, uninitialized, or empty.
The TUI is mouse-aware: control rows, summary cards, modal option rows, confirm-prompt buttons, and the detail-pane action button strip are real Textual widgets that accept both keyboard and mouse input. Mouse and keyboard selection share a single `--selected` class on the same row widget, so the two input modes cannot drift into separate tracks; click targets are additive rather than replacements for the underlying keyboard bindings.

### Future API and expanded daemon layer

No API server, web UI, operation worker, or broad external provider observer set is implemented yet. Cloudflare and SES provider observations exist as read-only provider observers, and operation history exists for foreground workflows. When introduced, additional layers should:
- call the same service layer used by CLI commands
- use the SQLite state store for cached observations, operation history, and fast reads
- keep provider-specific logic in provider modules rather than API handlers
- leave the CLI available for bootstrap, SSH recovery, scripting, and agent workflows

The daemon begins as a read-only observer/reconciler that keeps the cache fresh before it owns mutation queues. Foreground mutation workflows can record `operations` and `events` so operator-facing surfaces can explain what happened. Future API/web clients should call services and state-store helpers rather than duplicating command logic, provider logic, or SQL.

### Public contract changes should be deliberate

The following are public contracts for this project:

- CLI command names and major flags
- JSON output shapes
- global config file format
- stack-local `homesrvctl.yml` format
- generated scaffold file layout where it is documented

These can change, but they should not drift accidentally. User-visible changes should be reflected in:
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)
- [`README.md`](README.md) when appropriate
- [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) when scope or direction changes

### Avoid premature layering

This repo does not use a heavy domain/application/persistence architecture, and that is intentional. The current structure is module-oriented:

- command modules
- config/models
- service integration helpers
- scaffold/templates

Future refactors should preserve clarity, but should not introduce extra layers unless they simplify a real maintenance problem.

## Planned Evolution

The repo now has explicit bootstrap slices for the first Debian-family host target: assessment, Cloudflare tunnel provisioning, host runtime convergence, shared-group `cloudflared` wiring, and final readiness validation. This is still an operator-run sequence, not a single unattended first-run wizard.

Future bootstrap work should continue building on the existing bootstrap layer as an orchestrator. It should call into the existing Cloudflare and `cloudflared` helpers where possible rather than scattering host-provisioning logic across unrelated command modules.

For mail-provider work, the same rule applies:

- the current SES provider observer owns read-only AWS SDK/API inspection and SES-specific status normalization
- a future [`homesrvctl/commands/mail_cmd.py`](homesrvctl/commands/mail_cmd.py) should define any operator-facing mail mutation or planning verbs
- the TUI should consume mail-provider behavior through the JSON command surface rather than reaching into provider helpers directly
- app templates should remain separate from the mail admin surface; per-app mail runtime wiring is not the same concern as domain/admin inspection

## Testing Model

Current verification centers on:
- command behavior
- JSON output stability
- config resolution
- Cloudflare and `cloudflared` integration helpers
- scaffold generation

Primary local verification commands are recorded in [`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md).

## Evolution Rules

- Prefer small, end-to-end slices.
- Prefer idempotent mutation behavior.
- Add regression tests when:
  - a command gains a new runtime branch
  - a command gains a new output mode
  - a public contract changes
- Update this document when the repo structure or module responsibilities change materially.
