# Architecture

This document describes the current structure of `homesrvctl`, the boundaries between major modules, and the public contracts that should not drift casually.

## Design Goals

- Keep the operator model simple and explicit.
- Prefer convergent, idempotent mutation commands.
- Keep external-system integrations isolated from command wiring.
- Preserve stable public contracts where practical.
- Grow the project in small slices rather than speculative abstraction.

## Major Components

### CLI surface

- [`homesrvctl/main.py`](homesrvctl/main.py)
- [`homesrvctl/commands`](homesrvctl/commands)

Responsibilities:
- define the user-facing command tree
- parse flags and arguments
- format human-readable and JSON output
- orchestrate lower-level helpers
- host the terminal UI entrypoint

Should not do:
- embed Cloudflare request details directly
- embed `cloudflared` config parsing logic directly
- spread shell/process logic across individual commands

### Config and model layer

- [`homesrvctl/models.py`](homesrvctl/models.py)
- [`homesrvctl/config.py`](homesrvctl/config.py)

Responsibilities:
- define global config structure
- define stack-local config structure
- resolve config paths and defaults
- load effective stack-local overrides

This is the source of truth for:
- global config shape
- stack-local `homesrvctl.yml` shape
- default path conventions

### Cloudflare integration

- [`homesrvctl/cloudflare.py`](homesrvctl/cloudflare.py)

Responsibilities:
- Cloudflare DNS API interactions
- zone lookup
- DNS record inspection, upsert, and removal
- tunnel-target-related helper logic used by domain and tunnel-inspection flows

This module should stay focused on Cloudflare control-plane behavior, not local runtime orchestration.

### Cloudflared ingress and runtime integration

- [`homesrvctl/cloudflared.py`](homesrvctl/cloudflared.py)
- [`homesrvctl/cloudflared_service.py`](homesrvctl/cloudflared_service.py)

Responsibilities:
- parse and validate `cloudflared` ingress config
- reconcile ingress entries for domain lifecycle commands
- detect `cloudflared` runtime mode
- inspect whether the configured `cloudflared` path is aligned with the active runtime
- inspect whether the current user can read the configured tunnel credentials JSON
- generate systemd-oriented setup guidance for the supported shared-group `root:homesrvctl` layout when the runtime, config path, or credentials access diverge
- select restart/log commands appropriate for the detected runtime

Keep a clear separation between:
- config-file semantics
- runtime/process management

### Scaffold and template layer

- [`homesrvctl/templates.py`](homesrvctl/templates.py)
- [`homesrvctl/template_catalog.py`](homesrvctl/template_catalog.py)
- [`homesrvctl/templates/site`](homesrvctl/templates/site)
- [`homesrvctl/templates/app`](homesrvctl/templates/app)

Responsibilities:
- render scaffold templates
- define the shipped scaffold catalog for commands, TUI flows, and release verification
- keep template families organized
- support site and app initialization without making `homesrvctl` a general-purpose framework generator

The per-template directory layout under `templates/app/` is intentional and should be preserved.
The scaffold catalog should stay as the source of truth for shipped app-template names, operator-facing descriptions, and rendered file manifests.
`site init` remains a separate minimal scaffold family from `app init --template static`; that split is intentional until a later design decision says otherwise.
Scaffold scope should stay within the philosophy recorded in [`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md): small deployable baselines, not framework stacks.

### Shared utilities

- [`homesrvctl/shell.py`](homesrvctl/shell.py)
- [`homesrvctl/utils.py`](homesrvctl/utils.py)

Responsibilities:
- common shell execution behavior
- filesystem helpers
- shared small utilities used by command modules

These helpers should stay generic and reusable rather than accumulating feature-specific logic.

## Current Architectural Boundaries

### Commands should orchestrate, not reimplement helpers

Command modules may decide:
- what action to run
- which helper to call
- how to present the result

Command modules should avoid:
- custom YAML parsing when `cloudflared.py` already owns it
- ad hoc Cloudflare API requests
- ad hoc subprocess behavior already covered by `shell.py`

The TUI command wrapper follows the same rule: it should prefer orchestrating stable JSON command output over reaching into unrelated modules directly unless that boundary becomes a maintenance problem.

### Terminal UI layer

- [`homesrvctl/tui`](homesrvctl/tui)

Responsibilities:
- host the Textual application and related screens/widgets
- load dashboard and action data from the existing JSON command surface
- render terminal dashboard views, detail panes, and guided flows
- manage TUI-local selection and detail state
- keep TUI-specific state and refresh behavior out of the command modules

This layer should stay separate from CLI wiring so future dashboard/view growth does not bloat `homesrvctl/commands`.
Textual is now the active and only retained implementation for `homesrvctl tui`.
The command wrapper should import the Textual app lazily so the rest of the CLI can still start cleanly if the local environment has not yet been refreshed to include the new dependency.
The shipped TUI now covers the public CLI surface with a mix of guided mutation flows, focused tool menus, and read-only detail views instead of relying on a separate backend model.
The TUI is mouse-aware: control rows, summary cards, modal option rows, confirm-prompt buttons, and the detail-pane action button strip are real Textual widgets that accept both keyboard and mouse input. Mouse and keyboard selection share a single `--selected` class on the same row widget, so the two input modes cannot drift into separate tracks; click targets are additive rather than replacements for the underlying keyboard bindings.

### Public contract changes should be deliberate

The following are public contracts for this project:

- CLI command names and major flags
- JSON output shapes
- global config file format
- stack-local `homesrvctl.yml` format
- generated scaffold file layout where it is documented

These can change, but they should not drift accidentally. User-visible changes should be reflected in:
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)
- [`README.md`](README.md) when appropriate
- [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) when scope or direction changes

### Avoid premature layering

This repo does not use a heavy domain/application/persistence architecture, and that is intentional. The current structure is module-oriented:

- command modules
- config/models
- service integration helpers
- scaffold/templates

Future refactors should preserve clarity, but should not introduce extra layers unless they simplify a real maintenance problem.

## Planned Evolution

The current repo still assumes the host platform already exists. A planned future bootstrap milestone will likely introduce a dedicated orchestration area for:

- fresh-host assessment
- Debian-family package/runtime provisioning
- baseline Traefik and `cloudflared` service wiring
- Cloudflare tunnel creation through the API

That future bootstrap layer should remain an orchestrator. It should call into the existing Cloudflare and `cloudflared` helpers where possible rather than scattering host-provisioning logic across unrelated command modules.

## Testing Model

Current verification centers on:
- command behavior
- JSON output stability
- config resolution
- Cloudflare and `cloudflared` integration helpers
- scaffold generation

Primary local verification commands are recorded in [`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md).

## Evolution Rules

- Prefer small, end-to-end slices.
- Prefer idempotent mutation behavior.
- Add regression tests when:
  - a command gains a new runtime branch
  - a command gains a new output mode
  - a public contract changes
- Update this document when the repo structure or module responsibilities change materially.
