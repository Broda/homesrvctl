# Project Context

This document records the working assumptions for `homesrvctl`: what the project is for, what it intentionally does not try to be, and how to verify changes locally.

## Project Purpose

`homesrvctl` is evolving from a command-oriented CLI into a local self-hosting control plane for a home-server setup built around:
- Cloudflare Tunnel
- Traefik
- Docker Compose

The project focuses on:
- scaffolding deployable hostname stacks
- managing domain routing state
- validating local hosting setup
- indexing observed local state in a rebuildable SQLite store
- cataloging read-only site operations metadata
- planning guarded site operations without executing mutations
- moving reusable business logic into Python services
- keeping operator workflows simple and repeatable

The CLI remains a first-class interface for bootstrap, SSH usage, scripting, recovery, and agent-assisted workflows. The read-only daemon and any future API or web surfaces should reuse the same services and state store instead of replacing the CLI or duplicating provider logic.

## Non-Goals

`homesrvctl` is not trying to be:
- a full infrastructure-as-code framework
- a generic application framework generator
- a replacement for Docker Compose, Traefik, or `cloudflared`
- an all-purpose Cloudflare administration tool
- a general-purpose infrastructure-as-code framework

The project should stay narrow enough that operators can understand what each command changes.

## Scaffold Boundary

Scaffolds in `homesrvctl` are meant to produce small, deployable hosting baselines.

They may include:
- Compose
- a minimal Dockerfile
- a minimal runtime entrypoint
- basic static assets
- a small generated README
- healthchecks

They should not include by default:
- large framework starters
- frontend build pipelines
- databases
- auth systems
- migrations
- production app architecture choices

If a new template would require substantial framework-specific machinery, that should be treated as a separate product decision rather than the automatic next scaffold.

The current deliberate exception is `app init --template rust-react-postgres`.
That template is allowed to include:
- a frontend build pipeline
- an internal Postgres service
- a starter SQL migration

It fits the project because it is still a narrow stack-local hosting baseline rather than a generalized app generator:
- one shipped stack shape
- one frontend build path
- one backend runtime
- one internal database
- no extra platform abstraction, auth system, or deployment orchestration

Build-based static frameworks may still fit when they stay narrow and explicit. For example, a Jekyll-style workflow can fit as a deliberate `app` template decision if it remains:
- a stack-local source tree under the hostname directory
- a containerized build plus static serving baseline
- manually adopted from an existing repo in the first slice

It should not expand into:
- repo sync or pull orchestration
- CI/CD publishing workflows
- generic multi-framework build pipeline management

## Product Principles

- Correctness over convenience.
- Convergent/idempotent mutation commands over fragile imperative flows.
- Small operator-facing commands over highly abstract orchestration.
- Clear public contracts over accidental output or config drift.
- Local verification should be straightforward and reproducible.
- Config files and live systems remain the source of intent and reality until a later slice deliberately changes that contract.
- SQLite stores cached, observed state and history; it must stay rebuildable and must not store secrets.
- The daemon and observers refresh cached state; systemd support manages only the daemon process lifecycle. They must not mutate stacks, routing, provider state, or secrets.
- Provider observers are read-only until a later explicit convergence milestone; live provider systems remain the source of truth.
- Provider observer snapshots may include public DNS requirements, but must not store AWS credentials, Cloudflare tokens, SMTP credentials, or other secrets.
- OpenTofu support is narrow and operator-approved. Apply is foreground-only, saved-plan-only, and must not run from the daemon or a background queue.
- Generated workspaces and SQLite events must not contain provider credentials or secrets. Saved OpenTofu plan files may contain sensitive values and should be treated as protected local artifacts.
- Operation history is for transparency and future queueing. It must not store secrets, saved plan contents, or full provider/tool output, and it must not imply background mutations without a later explicit worker design.
- The site catalog is read-only operations metadata. It may plan guarded operations, but it must not read `.env` files, emit Compose `environment` values, expose secret values, or become a mutation surface.

## Public Contracts

Treat these as stable contracts unless there is a clear reason to change them:

- CLI command names and major options
- JSON output shapes
- config file formats
- stack-local override file format
- documented scaffold output layout

If one of these changes, update the relevant docs and tests in the same slice.

## Verification Commands

These are the standard local verification commands for this repository.

### Setup

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

### Compile

```bash
uv run python -m compileall homesrvctl tests
```

### Test

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

### Build

```bash
uv build
```

Use the build step when packaging, release automation, or project metadata changes are involved.

## Release Context

- The distribution name is `homesrvctl`.
- The CLI command is `homesrvctl`.
- Tagged releases use `vX.Y.Z`.
- GitHub Releases, TestPyPI, and PyPI are all part of the release path.

Details live in [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md).

## Documentation Expectations

When making meaningful changes:
- update [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for user-visible changes
- update [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) if scope or milestone direction changes
- update [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) if structure or module boundaries change
- update [`FILE_MAP.md`](FILE_MAP.md) if new top-level docs, modules, or template families are added
- update the sibling GitHub wiki checkout at `../homesrvctl.wiki` when the change affects user-facing guidance and that checkout exists locally
- run [`scripts/check_wiki_sync.sh`](scripts/check_wiki_sync.sh) as an advisory guard before closing a user-facing slice

## Current Development Focus

The roadmap is milestone-based. Before non-trivial work, check the active next milestone in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) and keep the change aligned with that scope.

## Practical Rule

Do not add process for its own sake. Add structure where it reduces drift, clarifies ownership, or protects public contracts.
