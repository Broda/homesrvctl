# Changelog

All notable changes to `homesrvctl` should be recorded here.

This file is intentionally lightweight. It does not need to repeat every commit. It should capture user-facing changes, release-level milestones, and breaking or potentially surprising behavior changes.

The format is loosely based on Keep a Changelog, but kept simple for this project.
