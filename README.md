# Home Server Controller (`homesrvctl`)

MIT licensed.

Home Server Controller (`homesrvctl`) is a production-oriented Python CLI for managing a home-server hosting platform built around:

- Cloudflare DNS
- a locally managed Cloudflare Tunnel via `cloudflared`
- Traefik for local hostname routing
- Docker Compose for workloads
- a shared external Docker network named `web`

It automates the repetitive parts of:

- adding apex and wildcard tunnel DNS routes for a new domain
- reconciling local `cloudflared` ingress entries for new domains
- inspecting the configured Cloudflare Tunnel reference and resolved tunnel UUID
- scaffolding static sites and app directories
- starting and stopping per-hostname Compose stacks
- validating the local hosting environment
- diagnosing a specific hostname

## Assumptions

`homesrvctl` intentionally preserves the existing operating model:

- Cloudflare Tunnel handles domain-level ingress
- Traefik handles hostname routing on the server
- Docker Compose runs each site or app
- once `example.com` and `*.example.com` are routed to the tunnel, additional subdomains only need local server changes

The tool assumes:

- Linux on the server
- `cloudflared` is already installed and configured
- `docker` and `docker compose` are already installed
- Traefik is already working
- a shared external Docker network such as `web` already exists
- the Cloudflare Tunnel is locally managed and already functional

## Installation

From the project directory:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

From PyPI:

```bash
pip install homesrvctl
```

From a tagged GitHub release:

```bash
pip install "homesrvctl @ https://github.com/Broda/homesrvctl/archive/refs/tags/v0.2.0.tar.gz"
```

The published Python distribution name is `homesrvctl`. The CLI command is also `homesrvctl`.

`homesrvctl` is published to PyPI. GitHub Releases remain available as an additional artifact channel.

## Configuration

Initialize the default config:

```bash
homesrvctl config init
homesrvctl config init --json
homesrvctl config show
homesrvctl config show --stack example.com --json
```

That writes:

```text
~/.config/homesrvctl/config.yml
```

Default config shape:

```yaml
tunnel_name: homesrvctl-tunnel
sites_root: /srv/homesrvctl/sites
docker_network: web
traefik_url: http://localhost:8081
cloudflared_config: /etc/cloudflared/config.yml
cloudflare_api_token: ""
```

The top-level `docker_network` and `traefik_url` values are the implicit default routing profile for stacks that do not opt into anything else.

Optional routing profiles may also be defined in the main config:

```yaml
profiles:
  edge:
    docker_network: edge
    traefik_url: http://localhost:9000
  internal:
    docker_network: internal-web
    traefik_url: http://localhost:8082
```

`cloudflare_api_token` may also be supplied via the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` environment variable.
It should have at least `Zone:Read` and `DNS:Edit` for the zones you want `homesrvctl domain add` to manage.
If you want API-backed tunnel inspection via `homesrvctl tunnel status` and API-backed tunnel resolution when no local UUID is available, the token must also be able to read the relevant Cloudflare Tunnel in the owning account.
Tunnel resolution is now explicit: local UUID from `tunnel_name` or the local `cloudflared` config first, then account-scoped API lookup when credentials context exists. There is no `cloudflared tunnel info` fallback.

Per-stack overrides may also be stored in:

```text
/srv/homesrvctl/sites/<hostname>/homesrvctl.yml
```

Supported stack-local keys:

```yaml
profile: edge
docker_network: edge
traefik_url: http://localhost:9000
```

Routing model and precedence:

1. Global defaults come from the top-level `docker_network` and `traefik_url` config keys.
2. A stack may opt into a named routing profile by writing `profile: <name>` in its stack-local `homesrvctl.yml`, or by passing `--profile` to `site init` or `app init`.
3. Stack-local `docker_network` and `traefik_url` keys remain first-class one-off overrides and win over the selected profile when both are present.

Examples:

All-default stack, no stack-local config needed:

```yaml
# no /srv/homesrvctl/sites/example.com/homesrvctl.yml file
```

Stack that opts into a named profile:

```yaml
profile: edge
```

Stack that uses a profile plus one direct one-off override:

```yaml
profile: edge
traefik_url: http://localhost:9001
```

## Usage

Create config:

```bash
homesrvctl config init
homesrvctl config show
homesrvctl config show --stack example.com --json
homesrvctl site init example.com --profile edge
```

Add DNS tunnel routes for a domain:

```bash
homesrvctl domain add example.com
homesrvctl domain status example.com
homesrvctl domain repair example.com --dry-run
homesrvctl domain remove example.com --dry-run
```

Scaffold and run a static site:

```bash
homesrvctl site init example.com
homesrvctl up example.com
```

Scaffold and run a subdomain site:

```bash
homesrvctl site init notes.example.com
homesrvctl up notes.example.com
```

Scaffold a Node app:

```bash
homesrvctl app init app.example.com --template node
```

Scaffold a static website:

```bash
homesrvctl app init www.example.com --template static
```

Scaffold a static website plus API:

```bash
homesrvctl app init portal.example.com --template static-api
```

Scaffold a Python app:

```bash
homesrvctl app init api.example.com --template python
```

Scaffold a Jekyll site baseline:

```bash
homesrvctl app init blog.example.com --template jekyll
```

Scaffold a stack with local overrides:

```bash
homesrvctl site init example.com --docker-network edge --traefik-url http://localhost:9000
homesrvctl app init app.example.com --template node --docker-network edge
homesrvctl app init api.example.com --template python --profile edge
```

Inspect the stack:

```bash
homesrvctl list
homesrvctl tui
homesrvctl tunnel status
homesrvctl cloudflared status
homesrvctl cloudflared config-test
homesrvctl cloudflared logs
homesrvctl cloudflared reload --dry-run
homesrvctl validate
homesrvctl doctor test.example.com
```

## Notes

- `domain add` uses the Cloudflare DNS API to manage apex and wildcard records for the requested zone.
- `domain add`, `domain repair`, and `domain remove` support `--json` for machine-readable mutation results.
- all `--json` commands include a top-level `schema_version` so automation can pin to a known output shape.
- `config init --json` reports whether the config file was created or overwritten.
- `config show` reports global config values and can also report the effective `docker_network` and `traefik_url` for a specific stack after stack-local overrides are applied.
- stack-local config may select a named routing profile with `profile`, and direct stack-local overrides still win over profile-provided values.
- `domain status` reports expected tunnel target, apex and wildcard DNS state, apex and wildcard `cloudflared` ingress state, whether a route is missing, duplicated, shadowed by an earlier ingress rule, or pointed at the wrong target, whether Cloudflare DNS is missing, of the wrong type, pointed at the wrong target, or ambiguous because multiple conflicting records exist, whether coverage is apex-only or wildcard-only, and whether `homesrvctl domain repair` is likely to fix the current state automatically.
- `domain status` also reports routing context for the apex stack, including the default ingress target, effective ingress target, selected profile, and source attribution for the effective target.
- `domain status` now also surfaces normalized ingress issues from the configured `cloudflared` file, separating blocking states from advisory wildcard-precedence risks.
- Blocking ingress issues include duplicate exact hostname entries and exact hostnames shadowed by an earlier broader rule; advisory issues keep direct remediation hints for risky wildcard ordering.
- `cloudflared status` keeps advisory ingress issues non-fatal while failing on a narrow set of blocking semantic-danger states, and the same normalized severity is available in text and JSON output.
- `list`, `domain status`, `validate`, and `doctor` support `--json` for machine-readable output.
- `up`, `down`, and `restart` support `--json` for machine-readable command results.
- `site init` and `app init` support `--json` for machine-readable scaffold results, including the selected template and rendered template-to-output mapping.
- `cloudflared status` reports the detected runtime mode, whether it is active, and the restart command when one is available.
- `tui` launches a terminal dashboard backed by the existing JSON commands for `list`, `config show`, `tunnel status`, `cloudflared status`, and `validate`.
- The Textual app title is `Home Server Controller`, which is the human-readable product name for the terminal UI.
- `tui` now launches a Textual app; reinstall the package or refresh the local dev venv after upgrading so the new dependency is present.
- `tui` requires an interactive terminal on both stdin and stdout, and it assumes the local machine has the same runtime access as the CLI commands it launches: Docker where stack actions are used, local config-file access, and local `cloudflared` runtime access where `cloudflared` tools are used.
- The JSON forms of `cloudflared status`, `validate`, and `doctor` stay quiet so they can be consumed directly by scripts and the terminal dashboard.
- The dashboard now uses a roomy warm-console layout with a full-width summary strip, a left control pane, a right detail pane, and a persistent command/status bar.
- After you run a stack action from the TUI, the focused stack detail pane keeps the last action result visible, including `doctor` checks and compose command results where available.
- The summary strip is informational only; the left control pane is the primary navigation surface.
- The left control pane groups a small `Tools` section above the larger `Stacks` section and uses a unified vertical cursor.
- TUI navigation uses `tab`, arrow keys, or `w`/`s` to move through the control pane.
- The TUI also accepts mouse input: clicking a control row, summary card, modal option, or detail action button is equivalent to selecting it with the keyboard, and mouse and keyboard selection share the same highlighted row. Mouse support is additive — every click target is also reachable by keyboard — and is quietly ignored when the host terminal does not report mouse events.
- The TUI now exposes a global stack-creation flow with `b` or the `Create` detail button, so operators can scaffold a brand-new hostname without first creating a placeholder row in the CLI.
- The guided create flow stays layered over the existing `site init` and `app init` commands, including hostname entry, create-mode selection, optional app-template selection, optional `profile` / `docker_network` / `traefik_url` inputs, and overwrite confirmation when the scaffold path already exists.
- The TUI now also exposes a global domain-onboarding flow with `d` or the `Onboard Domain` detail button, so operators can start from a bare apex domain even when no matching stack row exists yet.
- The guided domain flow stays layered over `domain add`, including apex-domain entry plus optional `--dry-run` and `--restart-cloudflared` choices, and when the domain does not yet map to a local stack row the resulting action and `domain status` follow-up stay visible from the `Tunnel` detail pane.
- When a stack is focused, `a` opens a small Textual template picker for `app init`, and the scaffold result stays visible in the stack detail pane after the prompt completes.
- The TUI now includes a `Config` tool item that renders the base `config show` output, and focused stack details also surface the effective per-stack config derived from `config show --stack`.
- The TUI now also includes a `Tunnel` tool item that renders the current `tunnel status` output, including the configured reference, resolved UUID, resolution source, and API tunnel status when available.
- Focused `Config`, `Tunnel`, and `Cloudflared` tool items can now open guided tool menus with `Enter` or `o`, so low-frequency global actions stay discoverable without replacing the underlying CLI verbs.
- The guided `Config` tool flow can now run the default-path `config init` path from inside the TUI, and it asks for overwrite confirmation only when the existing config file would need `--force`.
- Focused apex stacks now also surface `domain status` detail in the TUI, including overall state, repairability, coverage issues, and suggested repair command when available.
- Focused apex stacks can now run `domain repair` from the TUI with `p`, using the same CLI mutation path underneath and surfacing the result back in the stack pane.
- Focused apex stacks can now also confirm `domain add` with `n` and `domain remove` with `m` through a small modal prompt before the mutation runs.
- Focused stacks can also open a guided action menu with `Enter` or `o`, which lists the currently available stack actions and apex-domain actions for the selected hostname.
- When the `Cloudflared` tool is focused, the TUI can run `config-test` with `c`, `reload` with `l`, and `restart` with `k`, and the detail pane keeps the last tool result visible.
- The guided `Cloudflared` tool flow now also covers `cloudflared logs`, including a choice between standard and `--follow` guidance, and the suggested runtime log command stays visible in the detail pane after the prompt completes.
- When a stack is focused in the control pane, the TUI supports `site init` with `i`, and can run `doctor`, `up`, `restart`, and `down` for the selected hostname with `g`, `u`, `t`, and `x`.
- `cloudflared config-test` prefers `cloudflared tunnel ingress validate --config ...` when the binary is available and falls back to structural YAML/ingress validation otherwise.
- `cloudflared status` now also surfaces non-fatal config warnings when the ingress file is structurally valid but risky, such as an earlier wildcard rule that may shadow a later hostname rule or capture traffic intended for a narrower wildcard.
- `cloudflared logs` prints the right `journalctl` or `docker logs` command for the detected runtime and supports `--follow` plus `--json`.
- `cloudflared restart` also supports `--json` for automation-friendly dry-run and failure reporting.
- `cloudflared reload` is available when the detected runtime exposes a safe reload command; today that is primarily a systemd capability check rather than a guaranteed cross-runtime feature.
- `cloudflared config-test` now reports normalized ingress issues in JSON and fails on blocking semantic-danger states while keeping broader wildcard-precedence risks advisory.
- `doctor` now reports routing profile, default ingress target, and effective ingress target before the hostname-specific routing checks.
- `doctor` now also includes normalized `cloudflared` ingress issue severity so advisory risks remain visible without being flattened into hard failures.
- `domain add` also reconciles apex and wildcard hostname entries in the configured `cloudflared` ingress file so new domains route locally to Traefik.
- `domain add`, `domain status`, and `domain repair` honor stack-local `traefik_url` overrides stored in `<stack>/homesrvctl.yml` for the apex hostname.
- `domain repair` converges apex and wildcard DNS records and matching `cloudflared` ingress entries to the expected state.
- `domain add` resolves the tunnel target from the local `cloudflared` tunnel configuration and does not depend on the active `cloudflared tunnel login` zone.
- `domain remove` removes apex and wildcard DNS records and matching `cloudflared` ingress entries for the requested zone.
- pass `--restart-cloudflared` to have domain-changing commands restart `cloudflared` automatically when a supported runtime is detected
- without that flag, restart `cloudflared` manually after ingress changes
- `site init` and `app init` generate Traefik-safe router and service identifiers from the hostname.
- All generated Compose files join the external Docker network configured in `docker_network`.
- `site init` and `app init` can write stack-local `homesrvctl.yml` overrides for `docker_network` and `traefik_url`.
- `site init` and `app init` can also write a stack-local `profile` selection when you pass `--profile`.
- `site init` remains the narrow two-file static scaffold for quick hostname bootstrapping, while `app init --template static` is the richer static-site app baseline with nginx starter assets and operator guidance.
- `app init --template static` now generates a real boring-static-website scaffold with nginx, `html/index.html`, `html/favicon.svg`, `html/assets/css/main.css`, `html/assets/js/main.js`, `html/assets/images/`, and a small generated README instead of the old placeholder stub.
- `app init --template static-api` now generates a two-service scaffold with a static nginx site plus a small Python API routed on `/api` behind the same hostname, and includes a root `.dockerignore` because the API image builds from the stack root.
- The `node` app template now generates a runnable multi-file scaffold with `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `package.json`, `.env.example`, and `src/server.js`.
- The `python` app template now generates a runnable multi-file scaffold with `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, and `app/main.py`.
- The `jekyll` app template now generates a stack-local `site/` source tree plus a Dockerized Jekyll-to-nginx build baseline intended for manual adoption of an existing Jekyll site.
- To adopt an existing Jekyll repo, scaffold `--template jekyll`, copy the repo contents into `site/`, keep the generated `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile`, then run `docker compose up --build`.
- The shipped app-template catalog now drives CLI validation, TUI template selection, rendered-template manifests, and release packaging checks from one module so those surfaces do not drift independently.
- The `node` and `python` app templates now include a basic container healthcheck that probes the generated root endpoint on the app’s internal port.
- The `node` and `python` app templates now expose a dedicated `/healthz` endpoint, and the generated healthchecks probe that endpoint instead of the user-facing root response.
- The generated `node` and `python` app READMEs now include explicit first-run steps for `docker compose up --build`, health verification, and when you actually need a `.env` file.
- Scaffold regression tests now assert that the rendered `node` and `python` artifacts stay internally consistent across ports, healthchecks, and rendered template manifests.
- Scaffold artifact-coherence coverage now also locks down the shipped `site init`, `static`, `static-api`, `placeholder`, and `jekyll` scaffolds so template manifests, healthcheck expectations, and guidance do not drift silently.
- The generated Dockerfiles now use slightly more realistic defaults: the Node scaffold installs runtime dependencies, and the Python scaffold sets the standard runtime environment flags before installing requirements.
- The generated `node` and `python` sources now document and implement a clearer runtime baseline: `GET /`, `GET /healthz`, explicit environment-variable inputs, and `405` responses for unsupported methods.
- The generated `node` and `python` `.env.example` files now include only real runtime overrides used by the scaffolded apps, instead of extra metadata-style keys.
